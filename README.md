# FAQ && Shopping List
For the FAQ side, I created a questions.json file with all the dummmy data and imported using an async/await function to replicate incoming data from another source. This async function then calls the main createFAQ function.  I iterated over the data with a forEach loop and created all the DOM elements on the page dynamically using createElement, classList.add, createTextNode and append.  I then added an event listener to each block of data/question and when the button is clicked, to toggle classes on and off.  I used a timeout function to add a better UI experience along with a css trasition on the toggles.  

For the Shopping List side, I pulled in some of the premade divs and input box from the html/DOM.  I added Event Listeners for both click or on-enter key presses, so long as the input box has value. I created a lot of divs and list items with unique classes with document.createElement() and classList() and appened them to their parent divs.  I added a crossout line when each item is clicked on and also added a delete button for each item added to the list which is done the the removeChild() function.  The page should be pretty responsive as well when changing screen sizes.
